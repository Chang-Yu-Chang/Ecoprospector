# Ecoprospector

## Introduction

This package is designed for executing protocols on artificially selecting microbial communities of desired selected functions. The simulation is based on batch culture in which the microbial consumer-resource dynamics undergoes.

A preprint describing the use of `Ecoprospector` for directly evolving communities is here.

## Dependencies

`Ecoprospector` package depends on [community-simulator](https://github.com/Emergent-Behaviors-in-Biology/community-simulator) (developed by the Mehta group and this package was described in their [paper](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230430)), which depends on Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy that are all included in Anaconda distribution. 

A python development setup by [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) will be sufficient to implement `Ecoprospector`.

## Documentation

Please see the Jupyter notebook `Ecoprospector.ipynb` for explanations on the main functions of the pacakge.
