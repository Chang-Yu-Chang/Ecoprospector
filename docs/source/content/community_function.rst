Community Function
===================

Community function that is under selection at each generation. Inputs in this column should map to python functions in B_community_phenotype.py. 

[show list of options]

f1_additive
f2_interaction
distance from an arbitrary resource target (similar to Williams et al 2007)
resistance to a fast growing invader (similar to Wilson 1992)

An advanced user should be able to add functions that depend on any model and code it into the package as a function in B_community_phenotype.py
