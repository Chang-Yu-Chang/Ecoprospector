Selection Matrix
=================

Each cell has a string name that refers to a Python function that computes the selection matrix. A library of possible selection matrix options is saved in C_selection_matrix.py. The selection matrix represents what selection regime (i.e. which and what fraction of communities are selected, how much of a parent community is transferred into an offspring community) is used at the end of each generation. See the selection matrix section for how to make the selection matrix.
